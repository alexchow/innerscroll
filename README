Innerscroll

Inspiration from Facebook, iOS and Jonathan Azoff


Innerscroll provides an automatically fading in/out scrollbar
while maintaining 100% native scrolling behaviour
including (but not limited to) native performance,
native inertial motion (especially on Macs), native scrolling
with keyboard arrow keys, etc. To achieve an absolutely native feel, I allow the browser to
do the scrolling (unlike all other implementations I have found which override the
the browser with overflow:hidden and move the content manually, thus losing 
the native feel) and create an artificial scrollbar which imitates the real one.
